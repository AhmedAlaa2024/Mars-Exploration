# Project: Mars-Exploration

Course Name: Data Structures and Algorithms<br>
Course Code: CMP1040<br>
Team Name: The Phoenix<br>

This is an educational project for Data Structures and Algorithms, written in C++ using Visual Studio IDE. It is a simulation of a space station in Mars to explore the whole of Mars. So the station release its rovers and assign the messions to them everyday.

## Features
* There are 3 features:
  * Iteractive Mode: Writing the simulation's stages day by day on the console and create the output file at the end fo simulation.
  * Step By Step Mode: With every arbitary key press, the simulation move to the next stage (day) and create the output file when the simulation's stages are finished.
  * Silent Mode: Create Output file of the simulation without showing the simulation stages on the console.
* There is an input and output files:
  * The simulator read all the information and proccess them as it needs to start simulation.
  * The output file contains the final statistics generated after the simulation.
  *
* The simulation consists of:
  * Status of the Mars Station at every day.
  * Showing the numbers and IDs of the rovers in different states: (In Execution, In Checkup, In Avaliable) state
  * Showing the numbers of the missions in different states: (In Execution, In Completed, In Avaliable) state
