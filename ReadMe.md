# Project: Mars-Exploration
## Course Name: Data Structures and Algorithms
## Course Code: CMP1040
## Team Name: The Phoenix

### This is an educational project for Data Structures and Algorithms, written in C++ using Visual Studio IDE. It is a simulation of a space station on Mars to explore the whole of Mars. So the station releases its rovers and assigns missions to them every day.

# Features
* There are 3 Modes:
    * Iteractive Mode: Writing the simulation's stages day by day on the console and create the output file at the end fo simulation.
    * Step By Step Mode: With every arbitary key press, the simulation move to the next stage (day) and create the output file when the simulation's stages are finished.
    * Silent Mode: Create Output file of the simulation without showing the simulation stages on the console.
    
* There is an input and output files:
    * The simulator read all the information and proccess them as it needs to start simulation. [input.txt]
    * The output file contains the final statistics generated after the simulation. [output.txt]

* The simulation consists of:
    * Status of the Mars Station at every day.
    * Showing the numbers and IDs of the rovers in different states: (In Execution, In Checkup, In Avaliable) state
    * Showing the numbers of the missions in different states: (In Execution, In Completed, In Avaliable) state
